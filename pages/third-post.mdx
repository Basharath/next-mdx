Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. **No, I did not kill Kitty.** _However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide._ Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.

## No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.

It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Marry me. That's why you always leave a note! Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.

1. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.

There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Whoa, this guy's straight? Whoa, this guy's straight? Really? Did nothing cancel?

- No… but I'd like to be asked!

Really? Did nothing cancel? Guy's a pro. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. I'm half machine. I'm a monster.

I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.

There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. That's why you always leave a note! It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. We just call it a sausage. He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.

Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I've opened a door here that I regret. Michael! No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Michael!
